# Distance-of-distance transformation to improve t-SNE embedding in face of scattering noise in data

## 

## Method 
  For each pair of data points, we consider the joint set of K neighbours of these two data points, and then compute the distance of distance w.r.t. this set of neighbour points (see Methods 4.3). Using this transformation, we should be able to obtain a high similarity between noise points, while retaining the distances from noise points to the clusters, and the distances between the clusters.

## Results

### Example: GMM simulation  

### Example: CNN representation of image patches 

### Example: Neural represenation of drifting grating stimulus
